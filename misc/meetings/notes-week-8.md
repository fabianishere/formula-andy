# Week 4
- Chairwoman: Nikki Bouman
- Secretary: Laetitia Molkenboer
- Date: January 16th, 2017, 13:45-17:45

## Sprint
- Christian:
  Link the GUI to the client (Not completely done)
- Fabian:
  Create the server and link it to the client (Not completely done -> more work than expected)
- Nikki:
  Create the AI (in other words, the code for the randomly generated bots) and create a loading screen
- Laetitia:
  Create the last few screens, link those screens and put together all the pieces of the report.
- All:
  The draft of the final report

## Demo
We could not really show anything during the demo except for the linking of the screens, 
because the server was not done yet and thus the linking of the GUI to the client was not done, 
because not all parts of the client were finished. 
We were clearly too optimistic this sprint and maybe should have done more the previous sprint.

## Report and test coverage/checkstyle
Done

## Next sprint
- Christian:
  Rewrite the screens so they are easier to work with. Finish the linking.
- Fabian:
  Finsish the server and do all the remaining issues on the scrumboard.
- Nikki:
  Write tests for the AI and create the final presentation
- Laetitia:
  Create the final presentation and finish the report
