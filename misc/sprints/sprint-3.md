# Sprint 2
The third sprint of the project in which we will try to link all our currently
decoupled components like the front-end and back-end together and create an 
almost-ready-for-release product.

## Fabian
Fabian will link together the game algorithms to the game logic, which is then
connected to a REST interface. Then he will create a REST client, so that we
can connect to the server in Java from the front-end.

## Christian
Christian is going to link the front-end to the back-end code, so that the results
seen on screen are actual results calculated by the server.

## Laetitia
Laetitia is going to link all the JavaFX screens together, which means that from
the start screen, you can choose to login/register after which you can select
a lobby which you can join, etc. Finally, she will give the final touches to the
UI.

## Nikki
Nikki will develop the algorithm that decides how a computer controlled team is composed
and the configuration/parameters it will use during a game.
